ABOUT OBJECT TRACKING

The tracking process can be thought of as a combination of two models: the motion model and the appearance model. 
The motion model tracks the speed and direction of the object's movement.
At the same time, the appearance model is responsible for determining if the object we have selected is inside the frame.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Objective n° 1
Using the existing models and learn each process and find the difference.

Objective n° 2
Divide the tracking models according to their use cases.

Objective n° 3
Choose the better version and show the results.

SOURCES

First of all, I am going to apply the existing materials to get better understanding on what
object tracking really is and how actually it operates.
Then, learn each function of the code to apply it in our future project
Existing Platforms I have used various algorithms such as KCF, CSRT, Boosting and etc, to better understand what do
algorithms do.
But among those platforms I chosed the KCF as much more faster and qualitative model to use in comparison to other 4 models.
