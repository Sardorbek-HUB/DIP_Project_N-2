ABOUT OBJECT TRACKING

The tracking process can be thought of as a combination of two models: the motion model and the appearance model. 
The motion model tracks the speed and direction of the object's movement.
At the same time, the appearance model is responsible for determining if the object we have selected is inside the frame.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Objective n° 1
Using the existing code learn each process and apply it in real life.
Objective n° 2
Reproduce a new idea and add or remove the codes from the existing sources.
Apply them and analyze the differences and work on the mistakes
Objective n° 3
Maximize the possibility of success rate of the project by using open sources.

SOURCES

First of all, I am going to apply the existing materials to get better understanding on what
object tracking really is and how actually it operates.
Then, learn each function of the code to apply it in our future project
Existing Platforms I have used various algorithms such as KCF, CSRT, Boosting and etc, to better understand what do
algorithms do.
But among those platforms there was not a better and suitable algorithm for our purpose. So I used
different algorithm that is well known and modern

REPRODUCTION

I used Yolo7 algorithm to create object detection with naming each detected object and tracking them.
Moreover there are percentages for each object to how close they are for actual objects.
Afte running the code, it will take the pricture or the video and it will detect each object and (track them if it’s video)
name them one by one.
